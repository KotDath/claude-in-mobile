/**
 * DeviceResolver -- device lookup, listing aggregation, and selection.
 *
 * Extracted from device-manager.ts (D9.1). Owns:
 *   - Aggregating `listDevices()` across all adapters with per-platform error
 *     capture (so callers can surface ADB_NOT_INSTALLED vs an empty list).
 *   - Resolving a `deviceId` (and optional platform hint) to a concrete Device.
 *   - Propagating selection to the matching adapter.
 *
 * Behaviour-preserving: pure function set, no hidden state. The facade
 * (DeviceManager) still owns `activeDevice` / `activeTarget` mutable state
 * and calls back into these helpers.
