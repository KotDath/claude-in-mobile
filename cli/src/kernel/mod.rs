//! Rust mirror of the mcp-devices microkernel.
//!
//! Pair with `src/kernel/` on the TypeScript side. Provides the same
//! [`Capability`] enum, [`PluginManifest`] descriptor, [`SourcePlugin`] trait
//! and an in-memory [`Registry`] / [`Resolver`].
//!
//! Phase 6 deliverable: kernel infrastructure only. Platform handlers are
//! migrated into [`SourcePlugin`] implementations in Phase 7.
